Blinkit Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project presents a Blinkit Sales Analysis Dashboard developed in Power BI to analyze sales performance, outlet distribution, and customer preferences.

In this project, I worked on data cleaning, data modeling, creating DAX measures, and designing interactive dashboards to deliver meaningful insights. The dashboard provides analysis of:

* Total sales, items sold, average sales, and average rating
* Sales trends based on outlet establishment year
* Sales contribution by outlet size and location type
* Performance by item type and fat content
* Comparative analysis of grocery stores and supermarkets

This project helped me enhance my skills in ETL, KPI design, and interactive visualization, enabling the transformation of raw retail data into actionable business insights.

The dashboard includes:

* KPI Cards: Total Sales, Total Items, Average Sales, and Average Rating

* Visuals:
      * Line chart for sales trends by outlet establishment year
      * Donut charts for outlet size distribution and fat content comparison
      * Bar charts for sales by item type and location type
      * Matrix table for outlet type-wise comparison (Grocery vs. Supermarkets)

* Slicers: Outlet Location Type, Outlet Size, and Item Type for interactive filtering
